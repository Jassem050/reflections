When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote repository is neccessary to store all the files remotely where other members of a team can 
access or edit files or create seperate branches.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?
Unless a change is made in remote repo that are not in local, there is no need to pull.
